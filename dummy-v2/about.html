            <h1>About Art Taara</h1>

            <p>
                Art Taara is an artist-led curatorial platform focused on Indian art
                practices — both traditional and contemporary.
            </p>

            <p>
                We work closely with artists to present their work in ways that are
                respectful, contextual, and sustainable. Each project begins with
                conversation: about the artist’s practice, the client’s space, and the
                role art is meant to play.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rather than operating at scale, we choose to work slowly and deliberately,
                building long-term relationships with artists, collectors, designers,
                and institutions.
            </p>
