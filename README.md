## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile screens.

- **CSS-Only Animations:** Lightweight animations for the Hero Slider and Artist Cards (no heavy JavaScript libraries).
- **Semantic HTML:** Built with accessibility and SEO best practices in mind.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone or Download** this repository.
2.  Open the project folder.
3.  Double-click **`index.html`** to open it in your default web browser.
4.  Navigate through the links to view other pages.

## 🌐 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This site is ready to be hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

1.  Upload all files to a new GitHub Repository.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3.  Under **Build and deployment**, select **Source** -> `Deploy from a branch`.
4.  Select `main` (or `master`) branch and save.
5.  Wait 1-2 minutes, and GitHub will provide your live URL.

## 📝 Notes for the Client

- **Images:** Currently using placeholders (`placehold.co`). You will need to replace the `src="..."` links in the HTML files with your actual image files (e.g., `images/painting1.jpg`).
- **Contact Method:** The Contact page is designed as a "Digital Business Card." It uses a direct `mailto:` link which opens the user's default email app with the subject line pre-filled. This avoids the need for a backend server or database.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox & CSS Grid)
- **JavaScript** (Minimal script for Mobile Menu toggle only)
